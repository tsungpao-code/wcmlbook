# Exercise 2.15: CSI Compression and Reconstruction using CsiNet and CS-CsiNet

This repository implements two neural network models (CsiNet and CS-CsiNet) for Channel State Information (CSI) compression and reconstruction in wireless communication systems. Both models support indoor/outdoor wireless environments, adjustable compression rates, and provide complete training & inference pipelines with performance evaluation and visualization.

## What You Need to Do

| Step | Task | Details |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Code Preparation** | Ensure you have installed the required dependencies (TensorFlow 1.x or 2.x, Keras, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib). Create directories `data`, `result`, and `saved_model`. |
| 2 | **Data Preparation** | Place MATLAB-formatted CSI datasets and random projection matrices in the `data/` directory. |
| 3 | **Model Training** | Run `CsiNet_train.py` and `CS-CsiNet_train.py` to train the models and save their architectures/weights to the `result/` folder. |
| 4 | **Model Inference** | Copy pre-trained model files to `saved_model/` and run `CsiNet_onlytest.py` or `CS-CsiNet_onlytest.py` to evaluate reconstruction performance. |

## File Structure

| File / Directory | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CsiNet_train.py` | CsiNet training pipeline: model building, training, evaluation, saving. |
| `CsiNet_onlytest.py` | CsiNet inference only: load pre-trained model, reconstruct CSI, evaluate. |
| `CS-CsiNet_train.py` | CS-CsiNet training pipeline: train decoder with fixed CS encoder. |
| `CS-CsiNet_onlytest.py` | CS-CsiNet inference only: load decoder, reconstruct CSI from compressed data. |
| `data/` | Directory containing MATLAB-formatted CSI datasets and random projection matrices. |
| `result/` | Output directory containing training logs, loss curves, reconstructed data, and model checkpoints. |
| `saved_model/` | Output directory containing pre-trained model architectures (`.json`) and weights (`.h5`) for inference. |

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Part 1: CsiNet Training and Inference
An end-to-end residual-based autoencoder for CSI compression/reconstruction:
*   **Encoder:** Conv2D → Flatten → Dense (adaptive CSI feature compression). Fully trainable without needing a pre-defined compression matrix.
*   **Decoder:** Dense → Reshape → Stacked Residual Blocks → Conv2D (CSI reconstruction).

### Part 2: CS-CsiNet Training and Inference
A compressed sensing enhanced version of CsiNet:
*   **Encoder:** Fixed random projection matrix (non-trainable CS projection). Lightweight, no training needed.
*   **Decoder:** Residual-based structure (trainable for CSI reconstruction).

## Key Parameters (Modify at script top)

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `envir` | `indoor` | Wireless environment (`indoor`/`outdoor`). |
| `img_height/width` | `32/32` | CSI matrix spatial/frequency dimensions. |
| `img_channels` | `2` | CSI channels (real + imaginary parts). |
| `residual_num` | `2` | Number of residual blocks in decoder. |
| `encoded_dim` | `512` | Compression dimension (512=1/4, 128=1/16, 64=1/32, 32=1/64). |

## Performance Metrics & Important Notes

**Performance Metrics**
*   **Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE, dB):** `10*log10(E[|CSI_orig - CSI_rec|²]/E[|CSI_orig|²])`. Smaller (more negative) = better reconstruction.
*   **Correlation Coefficient (rho):** Range: [0,1], closer to 1 = higher similarity between original/reconstructed CSI.

**Important Notes**
1. Inference scripts must use the same `envir` and `encoded_dim` as the pre-trained model.
2. CS-CsiNet requires matching random projection matrix (`A{encoded_dim}.mat`).
3. Remove `tf.reset_default_graph()` for TensorFlow 2.x compatibility.
4. Code uses "channels_first" data format (do not modify without adjusting network).
5. Default training epochs: 1000 (adjust based on dataset/hardware).


## Q7(b): NMSE Evaluation on Each Dataset

In Q7(b), the trained CsiNet model is evaluated on each COST2100 dataset generated in Q7(a).  
The purpose is to test whether a model trained on one channel distribution can generalize to other user distributions.

The evaluation metric is NMSE:

\[
NMSE =
\frac{\|\mathbf{H}-\hat{\mathbf{H}}\|_2^2}
{\|\mathbf{H}\|_2^2}
\]

The model trained on `D1_indoor_uniform.mat` is tested on:

- `D1_indoor_uniform.mat`
- `D2_indoor_center.mat`
- `D3_indoor_edge.mat`
- `D4_indoor_hotspot.mat`
- `D5_indoor_ring.mat`
- `D6_indoor_line.mat`

The NMSE values are saved for comparison.

## Q7(c): Mixed-Dataset Training

In Q7(c), all six COST2100 datasets are mixed together to train a new CsiNet model.  
The purpose is to improve generalization by exposing the model to multiple channel distributions during training.

The mixed model is then tested on the same six datasets and compared with the single-dataset model in Q7(b).

If the mixed-dataset model achieves better average NMSE or smaller worst-case degradation, it indicates that mixed training improves the robustness of CSI feedback methods in practical wireless systems.
